Any surviving system should encounter many times of changes either major or minor; and these changes might induce the system serious problems and a lot of maintenance cost. According to the recent development of database reengineering, data warehousing and business reengineering, many organizations have had their information system operating for years. They are facing the problems of introducing a new database system and the re-designation of the data processing procedure. For the information system to serve effectively and efficiently as time goes by, there are two ways to improve it. Firstly, re-design the whole system by using new technology and new database models; secondly, introduce a method that will make use of the existing systems to the maximum extent while the new requirements are still satisfied, i.e. Information systems reengineering.

Some research efforts add a new ontological level above the conceptual one. This architecture has created two main actors whose presence is mandatory to ensure the success of applications: “conceptual designer” for conceptual and logical levels and “database administrators” (DBA) for physical level. Note that some administration tasks need some inputs from conceptual phase. Unfortunately, interaction between these two actors is negligible. Recently, some research and industrial efforts identify a highest cost of DBA and propose tools (advisors) to replace them, in order to ensure what we call zero-administration. The main limitation of these tools is their robustness. In this paper, we propose a new human resource management for database applications. Instead of replacing DBA, we claim to delegate some DBA tasks to conceptual designers. These tasks are usually those having inputs user requirements that may be translated to SQL queries. First, we propose a user make user requirements persistent into DWs. An analysis of requirements is given to identify SQL queries that may be used for physical design phase.

For the development of such standards, it is very important that we first examine the current practices being followed by the data warehousing industry. In this study, we review 30 commercial data warehousing methodologies and analyze the standard practices they have adopted with respect to DWP. To perform the analysis, we first develop an ontological model of DWP based on a thorough review of the literature and inputs from experts in the data warehousing field. The ontological model consists of two hierarchies: a composition hierarchy which shows the decomposition of DWP tasks such as system development, extract, transform, and load (ETL), and end-user application design; and a classification hierarchy which specifies the alternative methods or techniques available for performing the tasks. We next apply hierarchical cluster analysis to group the methodologies that share a common set of standards.

With the increasing amount of data stored by industrial organisations, some ETL processes can take in excess of 12 hours to complete; this can leave decision makers stranded while they wait for the data needed to support their decisions. After designing the ETL processes, inevitably data requirements can change, and much of the data that goes through the ETL process may not ever be used or needed. This paper therefore proposes a framework for dynamically detecting and predicting unnecessary data and preventing it from slowing down ETL processes - either by removing it entirely or deprioritizing it. Other advantages of the framework include being able to prioritise data cleansing tasks and determining what data should be processed first and placed into fast access memory.

Enterprise re-engineering involves addressing (emergent) changes, re-organizing, outsourcing, realigning, etc. In this paper, we investigate how to re-engineer enterprises by coupling high-level requirements and the data warehouse, leading to a process re-design that makes the business layer of an enterprise more effective. More specifically, we propose an approach to reasoning about enterprise's strategy together with data mining rules extracted from the data warehouse of the enterprise in order to make design-time changes to its business processes, primarily by means of eliminating redundant tasks and re-ordering inefficiently-located tasks. As such, the redesign is enabled by high-level strategic elements and driven by the enterprise data warehouse. The rationale behind this realignment is to combine yesterday's behavioral facts (i.e., mining enterprise's operational data) with today's operationalization possibilities (e.g., goals), which results in tomorrow's business model.

In the traditional/operational systems, requirements engineering has been divided into two phases: early & late requirements engineering phase. Most of the data warehouse requirements engineering (DWRE) approaches have not distinguished early requirements engineering phase from late requirements engineering phase. A very few approaches are seen in the literature that explicitly model early & late requirements for a DW. In this paper, we propose an agent-oriented approach having support from early requirements to late requirements modeling for a data warehouse. Here, the early requirements have been modeled through two models: organization model and goal model whereas late requirements are modeled through decision model. The proposed approach is illustrated through an example of the university for which DW is to be built to support decisional goals.",,978-1-4244-5209-5,10.1109/NCM.2009.226,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5331655,agent;early requirements engineering;late requirements engineering;data warehouse,Data warehouses;Data engineering;Proposals;Decision making;Information technology;Computer science;Systems engineering and theory;Programming;Computer architecture;Context modeling,data warehouses;formal specification;formal verification;object-oriented programming,early requirements modeling;late requirements modeling;data warehouse;requirements engineering proposals;agent-oriented approach;organization model;goal model;decision model,,3,,32,IEEE,13 Nov 2009,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
How specific should Requirements Engineering be in the context of Decision Information Systems?,C. Salinesi; I. Gam,"CRI, Université Paris I, Panthaon Sorbonne, Paris, France; CRI, Université Paris I, Panthaon Sorbonne, Paris, France",2009 Third International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science,19 Jun 2009,2009,,,247,254,"A decision information system (DIS) is a specific component of information system specialized in the support of decision-making by means of online analytical processing tools. Data warehouses (DW), at the core of DIS, integrate and historize collections of data often designed starting from the operational components of the Information Systems (IS). Methods, techniques and tools widely used in the industry to engineer DIS focus, mostly, on designing DW models. However a few approaches were recently proposed to deal with the early phase of DIS development and maintenance, i.e. requirements engineering (RE). As for other specific kinds of systems, the expectation is that better value shall be delivered to DIS users (i.e. different sorts of decision maker such as executives, or managers, as well as control managers or operational) if more effort is spent on analyzing their requirements in early phase of DIS engineering projects. However, DIS is very specific kinds of systems. Therefore the question is how specific should RE approaches be when developing a DIS? To addresses this question, we undertook an in depth analysis of (a) the specificities of DIS systems that shall have an impact on RE approach (b) expectations from DIS project stakeholders, and (c) gap analysis of DIS specific RE approaches and traditional RE approaches. The analysis is structured around the three main axes of RE approaches, i.e. formalization, specification, and consistency. The paper shows that although on a fundamental level RE for DIS approaches does not show conceptual differences with traditional RE for IS approaches, some differences exist in the way of working.",2151-1357,978-1-4244-2864-9,10.1109/RCIS.2009.5089288,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089288,Information System;Decision Support;Data Warehouse;Requirements Engineering,Information systems;Data models;Data warehouses;Project management;Engineering management;Management information systems;Decision making;Information analysis;Design engineering;Control systems,data mining;data warehouses;decision making;formal specification,requirements engineering;decision information systems;online analytical processing tools;data warehouses;formalization;specification;consistency;decision-making,,3,,34,IEEE,19 Jun 2009,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Thus, information quality of data warehouse becomes important and assessed by the quality of its data model. Various authors proposed different metrics for assessment of the data model quality at physical, logical and conceptual level. However, very less research proposals are seen in the literature to assess the quality of requirements data model. Requirements completeness and traceability metrics for requirements model are proposed and formally validated, but no empirical validation is witnessed in the past. In this paper, empirical validation of requirements traceability metrics is performed for predicting the understandability of data warehouse requirements schemas using support vector machine. The results showed high accuracy and precision for predicting understandability of requirements schemas. In this way, quality of requirements model may be improved and subsequently used for obtaining good quality of conceptual data model for data warehouse.",2325-9418,978-1-7281-6916-3,10.1109/INDICON49873.2020.9342245,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342245,Data Warehouse;Requirements Model;Requirements Engineering;Requirements Traceability Metrics;Understandability of Requirements Schemas;Support Vector Machine,Measurement;Support vector machines;Conferences;Data warehouses;Data models;Proposals,data models;data warehouses;support vector machines,data model quality;physical level;logical level;conceptual level;requirements data model;empirical validation;requirements traceability metrics;data warehouse requirements schemas;conceptual data model;information quality,,2,,32,IEEE,5 Feb 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Hence, it becomes necessary to maintain information quality of data warehouse. Many researchers suggested various metrics for the evaluation of data model quality for maintaining information quality of data warehouse. Data models are at different level of abstraction namely; requirements, conceptual, logical and physical model. Quite a few investigations were witnessed in the past for evaluating quality of requirements model in formal and empirical manner. In this study, formal investigation of requirements traceability metrics of requirements model for data warehouse is carried out by employing Briand's property-based framework to ensure whether they are valid and are defined in the approved manner which in-turn build the quality based data warehouse. Results showed that out of seven traceability metrics, five metrics are found as cohesion measure and rest two metrics are found as coupling measure; which concluded that these metrics are valid and defined correctly. Thus, these requirements traceability metrics can be used successfully to assess the quality of requirements model of data warehouse.",,978-1-6654-1272-8,10.1109/ICICCS51141.2021.9432071,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432071,Briand's Framework;Data Warehouse;Formal Investigation;Requirements Engineering;Requirements Schemas;Requirements Traceability Metrics,Measurement;Couplings;Hospitals;Organizations;Data warehouses;Software systems;Data models,data models;data warehouses;software metrics,conceptual model;logical model;physical model;requirements traceability metrics;quality based data warehouse;data warehouse requirements model;information quality;data model quality;Briand's property-based framework,,2,,26,IEEE,26 May 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The answer isn't easy because many sales prospects highlight numerous features—yet leave out to which degree they're supported and whether all features really matter. To gain insight into how current RE tools adapt to RE activities, we ran a 146-item survey based on the features covered by the ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009, a new framework for assessing RE tool capabilities. We received responses from 37 participants, covering all relevant tools. In addition to the tools' score in each activity, we assessed their performance in three concrete use scenarios.
