User Requirement Analysis in Data Warehouse Design: A Review,Nur Hani Zulkifli Abai; Jamaiah H. Yahaya; Aziz Deraman,Procedia Technology,Volume 11,,2013,Pages 801-806,ISSN 2212-0173,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.261.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017313004155),"Abstract: User requirement analysis is crucial in data warehouse design. It effects almost every decision throughout implementation of data warehouse or business intelligence system. Currently there are no standardization of user requirement analysis approaches had been outlined and this leads to complexity in data warehouse design. Various requirement analysis approaches have been proposed. However data warehouse designer unable to choose which approach most suitable to be adapted in their project. This paper review various user requirement analysis approaches that been classified into four categories; data-driven approach user driven approach goal driven approach and mixed driven approach. It also outlines their strengths and weaknesses within different contexts. The review enables readers to identify appropriate user requirement analysis approach suitable for their projects.Keywords: Data Warehouse Design; User Requirement Analysis

GRAnD: A goal-oriented approach to requirement analysis in data warehouses,Paolo Giorgini; Stefano Rizzi; Maddalena Garzetti,Decision Support Systems,Volume 45, Issue 1,2008,Pages 4-21,ISSN 0167-9236,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2006.12.001.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923606002053),"Abstract: Several surveys indicate that a significant percentage of data warehouses fail to meet business objectives or are outright failures. One of the reasons for this is that requirement analysis is typically overlooked in real projects. In this paper we propose GRAnD a goal-oriented approach to requirement analysis for data warehouses based on the Tropos methodology. Two different perspectives are integrated for requirement analysis: organizational modeling centered on stakeholders and decisional modeling focused on decision makers. Our approach can be employed within both a demand-driven and a mixed supply/demand-driven design framework.

Eliciting user requirements when there is no organization: a mixed method for an educational data warehouse project,Björn Christian Schaefer; Elif Tanr?kulu; Andreas Breiter,Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,Volume 28,,2011,Pages 743-748,ISSN 1877-0428,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.11.137.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042811025766),"Abstract: Steadily more statistical data about student performance from international large-scale assessment studies becomes publicly available. To facilitate access the eduDWH project aimed at building a data warehouse integrating three such studies for educational researchers. This target group is hard to access because it is not united through a single organizational context and individual researchers are not stakeholders in the warehouse project. This paper proposes an adapted mix of focus group activities and document analysis and reports about experiences while piloting these activities. It was found to be efficient for eliciting data warehouse requirements even with limited direct target user contact.Keywords: User requirements elicitation; Educational data warehouse; International assessment data

Ontology-based structured web data warehouses for sustainable interoperability: requirement modeling  design methodology and tool design methodology and tool,Khouri Selma; Boukhari Ilyès; Bellatreche Ladjel; Sardet Eric; Jean Stéphane; Baron Michael,Computers in Industry,Volume 63, Issue 8,2012,Pages 799-812,ISSN 0166-3615,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2012.08.001.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361512001200),"Abstract: The spectacular growth of the Internet and its widespread adoption by worldwide corporations lead to an enormous quantity of heterogeneous distributed and autonomous data sources. To facilitate the access to these huge amounts of data and make these sources interoperable two technologies may be combined: data warehousing and ontologies. Data warehouses are designed to aggregate data and allow decision makers in these companies to obtain accurate
 complete and up to date information. In the past decade Data Warehouse Technology (DWT) has been successfully applied in several domains such as telecommunication retail finance and many other industries. It supports a wide range of applications throughout the enterprise. The DWT has been largely used to offer sustainable solutions for enterprises. On the other hand ontologies are models for specifying the semantics of concepts used by various heterogeneous sources in a well defined and unambiguous way. Ontologies exist in various domains (E-commerce Engineering Tourism etc.) and are used to increase interoperability between sources. They may be used to improve communication between decision makers and users collaborating together by specifying the semantics of the used concepts. In this paper we propose a methodology for designing data warehousing applications from various sources. Each source has its local ontology referencing a global one. The presence of ontologies has three main contributions: (i) each owner of each source may use it to define his/her requirements (ii) it reduces most important types of conflicts that may exist in sources and requirements (schematic and semantic) and (iii) it facilitates the sustainable urbanization of the target data warehouse. Our methodology is supported by a case tool facilitating the tasks of data warehouse designers. Keywords: Structured web data; Data warehouses; Ontology-based databases; Requirements engineering

Reconciling requirement-driven data warehouses with data sources via multidimensional normal forms,Jose-Norberto Mazón; Juan Trujillo; Jens Lechtenbörger,Data & Knowledge Engineering,Volume 63, Issue 3,2007,Pages 725-751,ISSN 0169-023X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2007.04.004.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X07000717),"Abstract: Successful data warehouse (DW) design needs to be based upon a requirement analysis phase in order to adequately represent the information needs of DW users. Moreover since the DW integrates the information provided by data sources
 it is also crucial to take these sources into account throughout the development process to obtain a consistent reconciliation of data sources and information needs. In this paper we start by summarizing our approach to specify user requirements for data warehouses and to obtain a conceptual multidimensional model capturing these requirements. Then we make use of the multidimensional normal forms to define a set of Query/ViewTransformation (QVT) relations to assure that the conceptual multidimensional model obtained from user requirements agrees with the available data sources that will populate the DW. Thus we propose a hybrid approach to develop Dws  i.e.  we firstly obtain the conceptual multidimensional model of the DW from user requirements and then we verify and enforce its correctness against data sources by using a set of QVT relations based on multidimensional normal forms. Finally  we provide some snapshots of the CASE tool we have used to implement our QVT relations. Keywords: Conceptual modeling; Data warehousing; Requirements; Multidimensional normal forms; QVT

A proposed model for data warehouse ETL processes,Shaker H. Ali El-Sappagh; Abdeltawab M. Ahmed Hendawi; Ali Hamed El Bastawissy,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,Volume 23, Issue 2,2011,Pages 91-104,ISSN 1319-1578,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2011.05.005.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S131915781100019X),"Abstract: Extraction–transformation–loading (ETL) tools are pieces of software responsible for the extraction of data from several sources  its cleansing  customization reformatting integration and insertion into a data warehouse. Building the ETL process is potentially one of the biggest tasks of building a warehouse; it is complex time consuming and consumes most of data warehouse project’s implementation efforts costs and resources. Building a data warehouse requires focusing closely on understanding three main areas: the source area the destination area and the mapping area (ETL processes). The source area has standard models such as entit  relationship diagram and the destination area has standard models such as star schema
 but the mapping area has not a standard model till now. In spite of the importance of ETL processes little research has been done in this area due to its complexity. There is a clear lack of a standard model that can be used to represent the ETL scenarios. In this paper we will try to navigate through the efforts done to conceptualize the ETL processes. Research in the field of modeling ETL processes can be categorized into three main approaches: Modeling based on mapping expressions and guidelines modeling based on conceptual constructs and modeling based on UML environment. These projects try to represent the main mapping activities at the conceptual level. Due to the variation and differences between the proposed solutions for the conceptual design of ETL processes and due to their limitations this paper also will propose a model for conceptual design of ETL processes. The proposed model is built upon the enhancement of the models in the previous models to support some missing mapping features.

A requirement-driven approach to the design and evolution of data warehouses,Petar Jovanovic; Oscar Romero; Alkis Simitsis; Alberto Abelló; Daria Mayorova,Information Systems,Volume 44,,2014,Pages 94-119,ISSN 0306-4379,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2014.01.004.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437914000222),"Abstract: Designing data warehouse (DW) systems in highly dynamic enterprise environments is not an easy task. At each moment the multidimensional (MD) schema needs to satisfy the set of information requirements posed by the business users. At the same time the diversity and heterogeneity of the data sources need to be considered in order to properly retrieve needed data. Frequent arrival of new business needs requires that the system is adaptable to changes. To cope with such an inevitable complexity (both at the beginning of the design process and when potential evolution events occur) in this paper we present a semi-automatic method called ORE for creating DW designs in an iterative fashion based on a given set of information requirements. Requirements are first considered separately. For each requirement ORE expects the set of possible MD interpretations of the source data needed for that requirement (in a form similar to an MD schema). Incrementally
 ORE builds the unified MD schema that satisfies the entire set of requirements and meet some predefined quality objectives. We have implemented ORE and performed a number of experiments to study our approach. We have also conducted a limited-scale case study to investigate its usefulness to designers.Keywords: DW; ETL; Multidimensional design; Conceptual design

PROADAPT: Proactive framework for adaptive partitioning for big data warehouses,Soumia Benkrid; Ladjel Bellatreche; Yacine Mestoui; Carlos Ordonez,Data & Knowledge Engineering,Volume 142,,2022,102102,ISSN 0169-023X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2022.102102. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X22000933),"Abstract: Parallel DBMSs have become more and more mature and getting several success stories in the industry. This situation has been reached by powerful data partitioning and data allocation techniques and algorithms. By analyzing these findings closely we figure out that they are quickly stressed by the workload changes which represents the usual case of business analytics applications. To deal with this challenge in the context of big data warehouses
 several studies proposed to move to another processing paradigm outside the DBMS realm such as Spark by proposing adaptive partitioning solutions to tackle the workload changes. The majority of approaches are offline and those that are online cause significant random disk I/O costs. This is because the correlation that may exist between jobs and data blocks read from the disk is not captured to refine the adaptive partitioning algorithms. This represents one of the major causes of providing high performance of dynamic workloads. To solve such limitations we propose in this paper a proactive framework for query-aware adaptive partitioning (called PROADAPT) that uses an AI-inspired methodology that can be connected to any query optimizer managing partitioned data. This methodology uses a genetic algorithm to solve our formalized problem that considers the interaction that may exist among workload queries. PROADAPT intensively rewrites queries by exploiting dimension hierarchies to skip irrelevant data and then improves I/O performance. Different technical modules of our framework are discussed. Finally we conduct intensive experiments on Postgres-XL and a Spark SQL parallel cluster to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
